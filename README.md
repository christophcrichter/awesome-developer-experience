A list of awesome tools we use to improve our developer experience (DX)

## Connectivity

Escape from localhost while in development mode. Obvious security risks in production.

* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - secure introspectable tunnels to localhost
  * Use-case: you want to make your localhost server publicly exposed
* [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) - easily test, inspect, forward and create Custom Actions for any incoming HTTP request or e-mail
  * Use-case: you want to test/debug any incoming HTTP request or email without publishing your own server
